INSTANS 0.0.2 Release Notes
===========================

* Bug fixes
  - Changed parsing to accept functions calls through unknown IRIs. Now we produce a call to "instans:dynamic_call", which
    resolves the function in run-time. (0.0.2.3)

* Tests:
  - Syntax tests ignore malformed tests of property paths of type {n,m}, which have been dropped off the specs. (0.0.2.2)

* Refactoring and changes in implementation
  - Refactored old classes 'parser' and 'parsing' to two classes 'grammar' and 'll-parser', which has 'grammar' as its superclass.
  - Replaced macro with-ll1-parsing by a macro generate-ll-parser. The functions make-turtle-parser and make-sparql-parser
    now take an instans object, an input stream and return an ll-parser object. Calling 'parse' on that object does the parsing. (0.0.2.1)

Changes since 0.0.1
-------------------

* Tests:

  - Makefile in tests runs syntax-tests and friends nearby tests (correctly) friends nearby with 100 and 1000 events
  - New test script scripts/fnb-test.sh.
  - The tests compare the output to previous correct results in tests/correct-results

* Reporting:

  - Instans now takes command line option --report [all|select|construct|modify] and reports
     the execution of rules according to that
