+ fix bug in objectlist parsing in turtle-parser
  + fixed bug in turtle-parser RDFLiteral handling. Required (nth-value 0 (create-rdf-literal-with-type s $1)). This was fixed already in sparql-parser!
  + fixed bug in blank node lexing. Eat-blank loop had definition of 'ch' and 'prev-ch' in wrong order. Same in eat-identifier.
+ Why does friends-nearby not work?
  + Checking if we can delete old events
    + Fixed a bug in my test rule fnb.rq. Had FILTER (?event2 != ?event1), even though ?event1 is never set.  Got the simplest removal rule to work
    + Trying to find out why, exists-end-node does not produce any results
      + Fixed a bug in my test output (wrong order of fmt parameters)!
    + Yes
    + Fixed a bug in my triple input. Forgat to remove comments when changing the rule!
    + Trying to find out why when filter is called, the '<' is called with right looking arguments but still some error occurs
      + It was called with RIGHT LOOKING arguments, but there were two problems: 1) output showed that NIL was used as one of the arguments,
        a red herring, only the output was wrong (an extra NIL for some reason) and 2) the inputs were literals of type xsd:dateTime, not objects
        of type datetime. 
      + Fixed a problem in finding the xsd types. The type name string used "datetime" whereas the real name is dateTime.
    + Exists-end-node does not kill properly the counter and active-p variables.
      + replace list-difference ... with sparql-var specific versions
  + Going on to events with all fields. Seems to delete events correctly
  + Adding all rules
