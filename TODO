- Aquamacs home directory
- .config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d
- Parser generator: :RESULT nil not working. Replaced it by :RESULT (progn nil), but should fix the generator.
- indices.lisp: are the hash functions OK?
- Check that triple emitting produces the results in the right order
- Fix the hashing of rdf-iri's and other values in triple-pattern-matcher
  - Or canonize all values, so that eql (or equal) would work.
  - Maybe has to use weak hash tables?
- check make/generate variables/blanks
- check remove-dot-segments
- add instans as a (hidden?) variable to sparql-ops
- setting the base: trailing '/'
- translate-template: is it enough to create rdf-iri by just string?
- check that the compilation of node functions is done at the right place
- where (during of after the parsing of sparql) should we replace blanks with vars?
- at some point, check the efficiency of IRI and literal creation (cashing, lazy evaluation of fields)
- subselects should limit the variables that are passed forward in variable propagation
- unique identity of variables etc? E.g., in sparql-query-results vs. tokens.
- kill exists variables in vars-out
- check that literals with lang tags have a lang (results)
