- Make web server that
  * Runs INSTANS
  * Outputs dynamically the operations that INSTANS does (these must be configurable)
  * Provides the possibility to Undo/Redo
  
- Tasks
  + T1. Ask Mikko about creating the server
  + T2. http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/ Read the documentation
  - T3. Use websockets for two way communication:
       + Test hunchensocket
       - Find out the best way to use websockets in web client.
       	 + Ask Otto, Lassi
	 * Socket.io
         - Decide the client library to use
	 - Getting initial parameters
         - Establishing web sockets
         - Callback basics
  - T4. Launching:
       - Getting parameters for INSTANS
       - Generating RETE picture
         - Do it in the browser?
	   - Alternatives:
	     * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)#Layout_programs
	     * Canviz (https://code.google.com/p/canviz/). Inactive since 2013. Does not render my dot files.
	     * Liviz (http://ushiroad.com/jsviz/). Doesn't do decorations! Seems to be inactive!	     
	     * Viz.js (http://visjs.org/index.html)
	       + Chose this. Seems to be full fledged rendere.
  - T5. Instrument INSTANS to produce the output
       - Before/after/around methods
  - T6. Dispatching different RETE actions to javascript
        - Parameter handling
  - T7. Augment dot-based RETE-html page with infoboxes showing storage information
  - T8. Control in web client
       - Collecting RETE actions to a list?
       - How to pause and continue?
       - Undo/redo

  - V1: just listing the actions as text
    * Requires t3-t5
  - V2: listing the actions separating the parameters
    * Requires v1 and t6
  - V3: demo: augment RETE network with info on the point of activity and storage content
    * Requires v3 and t7.
  - At some point add action listing and undo/redo
