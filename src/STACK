- why does /2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/data-r2/(syntax-sparql[1-5]|bnode-coreference|construct) not produce any results?
- change the handling of IRIs and prefixed names in lexer to postpone expansion.
  - find out where the expansion happens now and when the expanded names are actually needed
- Make sparql result set output facility
  + Wrote new classes for this; don't destroy the old functionality, until the new thing works
  - Add calls to the new functionality to create results
  - Add comparisons
- Make triple input processors
  - Change the parser to be able to yield in between parsing
  - Take care that the result stack is kept OK.
