CEP2SPARQL Example
==================

This example considers all the types of event processing agents listed in [1] and shows a translation of each type into
SPARQL 1.1, forming an interconnected SPARQL-based event processing network.

To run the example, instans needs to be installed as instructed on the root level of this (INSTANS) repository.

The example can be run with the one-line shell script "cep2sparql.sh":

$ ./cep2sparql.sh
